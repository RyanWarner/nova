# Environments

For small teams, we recommend 3-4 environments. 1 local, and 2-3 deployment environments: `develop` (optional), `staging`, and `production`. Depending on team size, it can be beneficial to have a deployed environment for QA (staging) that has some guaruntee of being functional, while also having a deployed environment (develop) for developers to deploy to and break without consequence.

<br />

Each environment has its own `.env` config file located in the top level `config` directory. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/RyanWarner/nova/tree/production/config).


### Example .env file

**.env.production**
```
DEPLOY_ENV='production'
URL='nova.warner.codes'

S3_BUCKET='my-production-bucket'
AWS_PROFILE='profile_name'

AMPLITUDE_API_KEY=''
SENTRY_DSN=''
```

| Variable | Description |
|:---|:---|
| `DEPLOY_ENV` | Used to determine which .env file should be used. |
| `URL` | Used for the meta tag `og:url`. See `index.ejs`. |
| `S3_BUCKET` | The name of the S3 bucket. Used only for deploys from your local machine. |
| `AWS_PROFILE` | The name of your machine's local AWS profile. Used only for deploys from your local machine. |
| `AMPLITUDE_API_KEY` | See the [Analytics docs](/docs/tooling/analytics) for setup instructions. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | See the [Sentry docs](/docs/tooling/sentry) for setup instructions. |

### Naming

We recommend the following naming convention:

<br />

| Environment | Bucket |
|:-------------|:--------|
| Develop | dev.app.com |
| Staging | stage.app.com |
| Production | app.com |
