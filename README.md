# Nova

Open source, feature rich React boilerplate used to kickstart production ready web apps.

#### ⭐ [Live Demo](https://nova.warner.codes)

#### 📖 [Storybook](https://ryanwarner.github.io/nova)

## Getting Started

### Install project dependencies

- Requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 10`. [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended.
- `npm install`

### Developing locally

#### `npm start`

Starts a local dev server at localhost:8080. The port can be customized by updating the `PORT` environment variable in `.env.local`.

#### `npm run storybook`

Starts a local Storybook server and opens it in your browser.

### Deployment

The app is hosted on AWS using S3, CloudFront, ACM, and Route53.

CircleCI is configured to deploy to different environments based on changes to key branch names.

| Branch Name | Environment |
|:---|:---|
| `production` | production |
| `staging` | staging |
| `dev`, `develop` | dev |

#### Manual deployment

#### `npm run deploy:<env>`

This command will first build the app in production mode, meaning code will be minified and no local dev server will be started, using the appropriate environment config variables. 

```
npm run deploy:staging
npm run deploy:production
```

## Storybook

> [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation

All new components should have an accompanying `.stories.mdx` file containing the story and documentation.

`npm run storybook`

## Plop

Use [Plop](https://plopjs.com/) to scaffold new components automatically. To add or modify plop templates, see `plopfile.js` and `config/plop/`. 

```
npx plop Component
npx plop Page
```
